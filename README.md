# Work--Day-Scheduler

For this challenge I was tasked with modifying html and adding javascript to make a working calendar. 
when i click on a time slot box (like 9am) it lets me log an entry, I then click the "save" button 
when i refersh the page that entry still shows in the "9AM" slot.
I started withe main code that only had hours 9-11am, and added 12-5pm in the javascript. 
I ran into an issue with the "past" "present" and "future" colors showing up on the scheduler.
When I modified the java code to save the event thats added to the scheduler it made the colors obsolete. 
I learned a lot aboyt dayjs while making this code.
